# BookExploitFix
A [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin to improve the security of books with JSON content.

Minecraft books can contain interactive content, which can cause the user to run commands, open files,
or open URLs. While this feature holds great potential, it also introduces risks for hackers and griefers
which have misused it to take over servers in the past. While most server implementations have fixed
these issues for survival mode, creative mode servers are still vulnerable to this attack vector.

This simple plugin scans book content for click actions and allows the server administrator to define a
blacklist of actions which are automatically removed.

__For server owners:__ more information, installation instructions and completed builds are available on the
plugin page: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bookexploitfix.5897/

__For developers:__ contributions are welcome and encouraged. The plugin uses the maven build system, so
getting set up is simple:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/minoneer/BookExploitFix`

2. Build the final jar: `mvn clean package`

The build artifact will be in `target/BookExploitFix.jar`
